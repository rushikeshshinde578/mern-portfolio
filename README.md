Developed a full-stack web application using the MERN stack, featuring an admin panel for seamless data managementâ€”allowing administrators to add, update, and delete information. Implemented secure user authentication and a RESTful API for smooth communication between frontend and backend. Hosted on Render and Netlify for optimal performance, this project highlights my skills in modern web development and dynamic data management.
