My portfolio, built using the MERN stack, integrates MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for 
backend APIs, and React.js for dynamic frontend. Deployed on Render for reliable backend 
hosting and Netlify for seamless frontend deployment, it showcases my projects, skills, and 
contact information with modern web development practices.
